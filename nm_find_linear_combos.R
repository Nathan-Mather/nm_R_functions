#' nm_find_linear_combos
#' 
#' Takes a data.table or Matrix, finds perfectly colinear rows. Returns a list of all linear combination dependencies. For example, a list element of (2,3,4) 
#' implies that columns 2,3, and 4 are linearly dependent. The function then iteratively removes one column from each dependency and checks for remaining colinearities.
#' a list of the columns that were removed in those iterations is also returned. 
#'
#'@param data a data.table, Matrix, or and data that can be converted to a matrix with as.matrix. 

#'@export
#'@return linearCombos If there are linear combinations, this will be a list with elements for each dependency that contains vectors of column numbers.
#'@return remove a list of column numbers that can be removed to counter the linear combinations

#' This is substitutible with caret::findlinearcombos but is faster and uses rook pivoting and LU decomposition rather that QR decomposition. This is not 
#' an original algorithm, just an implimentation in R. Much of this code and processes is directly from caret::findlinearcombos

  # ==== start rook pivoting ====
  #==============================#
    
    # lu fractorization in matrix package does not do complete pivoting (column pivoting). So, use rook pivoing. A fast, numerically stable way to get 
    # an upper triangular matrix that will work, i.e. the zeros on the diagonal equal the rank and correspond to linearly dependent columns 
    # notes for coding are from  " http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~foster/m143m_f13/gaussian_elimination_algorithms_4.pdf "

      rook_m <- in_matrix
      
    }
    
    # make vector to track column chages. This is VERY important. Rook pivoting will swap columns in the matrix. So, if we find that the 3rd column 
    # in the output matrix is depdnent, this may correspond to a different column in the original matrix. To check, we will look at the 3rd entry of 
    # this vector. That will tell us which original matrix column corresponds to column 3 of the output matrix.
